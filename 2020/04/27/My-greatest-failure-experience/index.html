        <p>· Arguably, my greatest failure to date has been my competence in English which has led to disappointing results. In fact, I’ve never been brilliant at English but it did not bother me very much until I went to High School. Base on the learning condition and my personal character decided to pursue further studies in international high school. Although I was very keen to study at an International High School, I didn’t realize the importance of having a high level of English competency.</p>
<p>· In the first year,I had significant difficulties in adapting to studying here because all the things I never done it before like new class, new classmates, new subjects and so on. Also my level of English proved to be a stumbling block for me; I thought I had improved a lot but reality dealt me a harsh blow.I got a ‘C’ grade in English as the second language of the final IGCSE examination which means I would have a make-up examination in the September. </p>
<p>· As a result, in that summer holiday I really prepared for a long time. at the same time I also did a lot of preparation which included IELTs exercises. To my own mind my English have improved and I had the ability to pass the exam. As a matter of fact, during the test I did not meet any accident, but this is also the scariest part of the English test and you never know how well you’ve done until the grades come out. </p>
<p>· When the results came out the following January, I was so surprised because my score was even worse than before. This hit my hard and even now I could not understand the reason why although I had to because it was my greatest failure so far in my life. The first thought was that I had been unprepared but this was not accurate – on the contrary, I had made a lot of effort but still could not get the resulted I wanted. In the past if I’d failed at something, I would just work harder but this hadn’t happened in this case and I was doubting my abilities to succeed. This self-doubt was fatal because it left me with no confidence and no motivation to learn. Secondly, this was denial of my efforts which is just like  a warning sign that all my efforts had been in vain.</p>
<p>Therefore although I know that it is necessary for me to take this test again I still do not know how to face it. Despite many doubts, I have decided to confront my fears and re-sit the exam. Whatever the result, at least that I have tried my best. I do not want English to become a stumbling block on my way to High School because I understand that life has many stumbling blocks which must be overcome.  In this respect, I will not and cannot throw in the towel.</p>
